motion-playground
===================

RubyMotion playground. No idea yet, probably lame exercises.

step 0: clean app by rmq (https://github.com/infinitered/rmq)

    $ rmq create motion-playground

step 1: add some other view available by using button
  - where is border of the button?
  - how to go up from cmd+point in simulator, ButtonLabel -> Button (repl/console info needed)

step 2: add some styling for buttons
  - why border_width/color styler works as ui_button_styler but not as ui_view_styler (border_radius works as ui_view_styler)
